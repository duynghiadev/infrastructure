# Microservices Architecture

## What are Microservices?

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services that are:

- Independently deployable
- Loosely coupled
- Organized around business capabilities
- Highly maintainable and testable

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Service Independence

- Each service runs in its own process
- Services can be deployed independently
- Different services can use different technologies
- Services communicate via well-defined APIs

### 2. Common Patterns

- API Gateway
- Service Discovery
- Load Balancing
- Circuit Breaker
- Message Queues
- Database per Service

### 3. Popular Technologies & Languages

#### Go (Golang)

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "encoding/json"
)

func userHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    user := User{ID: 1, Name: "John"}
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(user)
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/api/users", userHandler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

#### Node.js (Express)

```javascript
// Example of a microservice in Node.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/api/products", (req, res) => {
  const products = [{ id: 1, name: "Product A" }];
  res.json(products);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Python (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/api/orders")
async def get_orders():
    return {"orders": [{"id": 1, "status": "pending"}]}
```

#### Java (Spring Boot)

```java
@RestController
public class CustomerController {
    @GetMapping("/api/customers")
    public List<Customer> getCustomers() {
        return customerService.findAll();
    }
}
```

### 4. Common Use Cases

- E-commerce platforms
- Banking systems
- Streaming services
- Social media platforms
- Cloud-native applications

### 5. Benefits

- **Scalability**: Services can scale independently
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different tech stacks per service
- **Resilience**: Failure isolation
- **Easy Deployment**: Smaller, manageable deployments
- **Team Organization**: Teams can work independently

### 6. Challenges

- Distributed system complexity
- Service communication overhead
- Data consistency
- Testing complexity
- Operational overhead

### 7. Best Practices

#### Design Principles

1. Single Responsibility
2. Domain-Driven Design
3. Decentralized Data Management
4. Infrastructure Automation
5. Design for Failure

#### Implementation Patterns

```yaml
# Example Docker Compose for microservices
version: "3"
services:
  user-service:
    build: ./user-service
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"

  order-service:
    build: ./order-service
    ports:
      - "8082:8080"

  payment-service:
    build: ./payment-service
    ports:
      - "8083:8080"
```

### 8. Communication Patterns

#### REST API

```http
GET /api/users/123
POST /api/orders
PUT /api/products/456
```

#### Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)

```python
# Publisher
channel.basic_publish(
    exchange='orders',
    routing_key='new_order',
    body=json.dumps(order_data)
)

# Consumer
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    process_order(json.loads(body))
channel.basic_consume(queue='orders', on_message_callback=callback)
```

### 9. Monitoring & Observability

- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging
- Health checks
- Metrics collection
- Performance monitoring

### 10. Popular Tools & Frameworks

#### Service Mesh

- Istio
- Linkerd
- Consul

#### Container Orchestration

- Kubernetes
- Docker Swarm

#### API Gateway

- Kong
- Netflix Zuul
- AWS API Gateway

#### Monitoring

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- ELK Stack

## Getting Started

1. Start with a Monolith
2. Identify Service Boundaries
3. Choose Technology Stack
4. Set up CI/CD Pipeline
5. Implement Monitoring
6. Deploy Services
7. Iterate and Improve

## Security Considerations

- API Security
- Service-to-Service Authentication
- Rate Limiting
- Data Encryption
- Access Control
- Security Monitoring

Microservices are particularly useful for:

- Large, complex applications
- Teams working independently
- Systems requiring high scalability
- Applications needing frequent updates
- Organizations with multiple development teams

Remember that microservices aren't always the best choice - consider the complexity and overhead before adopting this architecture.
